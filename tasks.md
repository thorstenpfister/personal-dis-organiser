# Personal Disorganiser - Future Development Plan

## Current Status

The Personal Disorganiser CLI application is now feature-complete with comprehensive testing infrastructure:
- âœ… Core CLI functionality implemented
- âœ… World-class test coverage (92.0% average)
- âœ… Performance benchmarking infrastructure
- âœ… CI/CD integration with automated testing

## High-Level Feature Opportunities

### 1. Smart Task Management ðŸ§ 
**Priority: HIGH** - Simple task enhancement focused on core productivity

#### Potential Features:
- **Task Dependencies**: Simple parent/child task relationships for breaking down complex work
- **Context Tags**: Tag tasks with contexts (@home, @work, @errands) for focused work sessions
- **Recurring Tasks**: Support for daily, weekly, monthly recurring task patterns
- **Task Templates**: Predefined templates for common task types (meeting prep, project setup)
- **Manual Prioritization**: Simple priority levels (High, Medium, Low) for better task ordering
- **Due Date Tracking**: Enhanced due date support with overdue task highlighting

#### Technical Considerations:
- Simple dependency graph (no complex algorithms)
- Tag-based filtering and grouping
- Recurring task scheduling logic
- Template storage and instantiation
- Priority-based sorting algorithms


## Next Steps - Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Smart Task Management Enhancement
1. Design task dependency system (simple parent/child relationships)
2. Implement basic task prioritization (manual priority levels)
3. Add context-based task grouping (tags: @home, @work, @errands)
4. Create simple task templates for common workflows
5. Add recurring task support (daily, weekly, monthly patterns)

## Technical Debt & Maintenance

### Code Quality
- Regular dependency updates (Go modules, security patches)
- Performance monitoring using existing benchmark infrastructure

### Testing
- Maintain test coverage above 80% as new features are added
- Update integration tests when core functionality changes

### Documentation
- Basic user guide (installation, basic usage, commands)
- Keep README.md current with feature changes

**Note**: Focus on maintaining simplicity and core functionality. New features should enhance task management without adding complexity or scope creep.
